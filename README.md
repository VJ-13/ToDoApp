The To-Do App is a simple and user-friendly task management tool, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The App interface is designed with a clean and minimalistic layout, making it easy to navigate and use. The App allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks and organize them into different categories. Users can also mark tasks as complete and view their progress at a glance.

The App uses JavaScript to handle the functionality of the interface and to store data. One of the key features of the App is the use of LocalStorage. LocalStorage allows the App to store data locally within the user's browser, rather than on a server. This means that the data will remain in the App even when the site is refreshed, making it more convenient for users to continue where they left off.
